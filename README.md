### ReadMe

This app will load a TDMS data file that was generated by a [Power Puck radiometer](https://www.cureuv.com/products/eit-power-puck-2-uv-radiometer) and extract the first channel of data to a CSV file. It also generates a summary and sub-sampled CSV files.


#### Disclaimer!
The code was lifted from a scratchpad app and so it isn't necessarily well written or robust. But it works for me ;-)
